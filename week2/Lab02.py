# 1. Name:
#      Grant Call
# 2. Assignment Name:
#      Lab 02: Authentication
# 3. Assignment Description:
#      Write a program to read the contents of the file into a list.
#      The program will then prompt the user for a username and password.
#      Finally, we will tell the user whether the user is authenticated.
# 4. What was the hardest part? Be as specific as possible.
#      The hardest part was figuering out how to autheticate the user.
#      The next hardest thing was fuguering out how to automate the testing.
#      It was more difficult that figuering out how to authenticate the user.
#      The difference was that figuring out how to authenticate the user took
#      longer and was harder for me to grasp the concepts.
#      The testing took more trial and error when I was coding
#      So that was why I considered it one of the most difficult parts.
# 5. How long did it take for you to complete the assignment?
#      It took me close to 12 hours to complete this lab.
#      This included reading documentation and trying to figure out
#      how to impliment what I was reading. I also met with several
#      professors to ask questions so that I would understand the concepts
#      I was using in code.
