# 1. Name:
#      Grant Call
# 2. Assignment Name:
#      Lab 10: Numeric Sequence
# 3. Assignment Description:
#      The program prompts the user for a positive integer
#      then it displays the nth or requested François number.
# 4. What was the hardest part? Be as specific as possible.
#      The hardest part for me was actually understanding the pseudocode
#      for the example. I struggled to understand this line:
#      array[index % 2] = array[0] + array[1]. It was confusing to me
#      and after I rewrote it several times that it finally clicked.
#      The other part for me was trying to understand how to write the
#      asserts that I wanted and make them work the way I intended them to.
#      I also strugged to figure out how to write the ttest cases and
#      how I would get them all to run without failing so I could display
#      each test case.
# 5. How long did it take for you to complete the assignment?
#      8 hours
