# 1. Name:
#      Grant
# 2. Assignment Name:
#      Lab 08: Sort
# 3. Assignment Description:
#      This program will read a list of names from a file and sort them.
# 4. What was the hardest part? Be as specific as possible.
#      The hardest part of this was figuring out how to translate the
#      psuedocode in python code. The hardest part about that was
#      figuring out the sort algorithm and implimenting it correctly.
#      The It was difficult figuring out what asserts to put into
#      my program and how to write them. The hardest asserts to understand
#      and to write was the the one that checked if the list was sorted.
#      The next was the index of out range asserts.
# 5. How long did it take for you to complete the assignment?
#      14 hours
